# My Project on Cybersecurity

Published at the **Kongrensem Symposium**.

This project encompasses various aspects of **software engineering** applied to cybersecurity, including:

- **Threat Analysis**: Identifying and analyzing potential security threats.
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Implementing best practices to prevent vulnerabilities.
- **Penetration Testing**: Assessing the security of software systems by simulating attacks.
- **Incident Response**: Developing strategies for responding to security breaches.

Through rigorous application of software engineering principles, this project aims to enhance the security and resilience of software systems.
